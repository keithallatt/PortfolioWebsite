# PortfolioWebsite

This is the repository for what will end up being my portfolio website, showcasing what I've uploaded here on GitHub.

I use a package from Michelf at https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/ that allows for markup to be converted to PHP code in the website itself. His license information is included in this repo.
