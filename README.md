# PortfolioWebsite

This is the repository for what will end up being my portfolio website, showcasing what I've uploaded here on GitHub.

I use a package from Michelf at https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/ that allows for markup to be converted to PHP code in the website itself. Their license information is included in this repo.

This software relies on caching, as the GitHub API will stop responding if bombarded with requests without authentication. Because PHP authentication packages are often large and bulky, and I'm only reading public info about my own repositories, I'm opting for not using an authentication package.
